# Set up and Configure a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

> ## **_GSP321_**

## **Topics tested:**

* Creating and using VPCs and subnets
* Configuring and launching a Deployment Manager configuration
* Creating a Kubernetes cluster
* Configuring and launching a Kubernetes deployment and service
* Setting up stackdriver monitoring
* Configuring an IAM role for an account

## **Challenge scenario**

As a cloud engineer in Jooli Inc. and recently trained with Google Cloud and Kubernetes you have been asked to help a new team (Griffin) set up their environment. The team has asked for your help and has done some work, but needs you to complete the work.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks so donâ€™t expect step-by-step guides.

You need to complete the following tasks:

* Create a development VPC with three subnets manually
* Create a production VPC with three subnets using a provided Deployment Manager configuration
* Create a bastion that is connected to both VPCs
* Create a development Cloud SQL Instance and connect and prepare the WordPress environment
* Create a Kubernetes cluster in the development VPC for WordPress
* Prepare the Kubernetes cluster for the WordPress environment
* Create a WordPress deployment using the supplied configuration
* Enable monitoring of the cluster via stackdriver
Provide access for an additional engineer

Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:

* Create all resources in the `us-east1` region and `us-east1-b` zone, unless otherwise directed.

* Use the project VPCs.

* Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named **kraken-webserver1**.

* Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share: unless directed, use `n1-standard-1`.

## **Your challenge**

You need to help the team with some of their initial work on a new project. They plan to use WordPress and need you to set up a development environment. Some of the work was already done for you, but other parts require your expert skills.

As soon as you sit down at your desk and open your new laptop you receive the following request to complete these tasks. Good luck!

## **Task 6: Prepare the Kubernetes cluster**

Use Cloud Shell and copy all files from `gs://cloud-training/gsp321/wp-k8s.`

The WordPress server needs to access the MySQL database using the username and password you created in task 4. You do this by setting the values as secrets. WordPress also needs to store its working files outside the container, so you need to create a volume.

Add the following secrets and volume to the cluster using wp-env.yaml. Make sure you configure the username to wp_user and password to stormwind_rules before creating the configuration.

You also need to provide a key for a service account that was already set up. This service account provides access to the database for a sidecar container. Use the command below to create the key, and then add the key to the Kubernetes environment.

```terminal
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
    --iam-account=cloud-sql-proxy@$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com
kubectl create secret generic cloudsql-instance-credentials \
    --from-file key.json
```

Click _Check my progress_ to verify the objective.

> **SOLUTION**

1. In the Cloud Shell, use the following command to copy the files for the Kubernetes:

```terminal
gsutil cp -r gs://cloud-training/gsp321/wp-k8s ~/
```

2. Open `wp-k8s/wp-env.yaml` with the Cloud Shell Editor.

```terminal
cd ~/wp-k8s
edit wp-env.yaml
```

3. Replace `username_goes_here` and `password_goes_here` to `wp-user` and `stormwind_rules`, respectively.

4. Save the file change.

5. After the Kubernetes cluster has created, click on the **Connect** button.

6. Run the following command to connect the cluster:

```terminal
gcloud container clusters get-credentials griffin-dev --zone=us-east1-b
```

7. Deploy the configuration to the cluster using:

```terminal
kubectl apply -f wp-env.yaml
```

8. Use the command below to create the key, and then add the key to the Kubernetes environment:

```terminal
   gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
       --iam-account=cloud-sql-proxy@$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   kubectl create secret generic cloudsql-instance-credentials \
       --from-file key.json
```
